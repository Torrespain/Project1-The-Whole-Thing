# Project1-The-Whole-Thing
Project1 Group 3

Developers:

David, Javier, Joyce, Ricky


Motivation:

Our goal was to build a product relevant to our daily lives. We found that we all shared the common interest of attending events, eating out and going out to drink. As a result, we narrowed our idea down to an app that could find out how to do all three of those quickly and simply.
