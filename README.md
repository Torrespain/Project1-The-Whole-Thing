# Project1-The-Whole-Thing
Project1 Group 3

Developers:

David, Javier, Joyce, Ricky


Motivation:

Our goal was to build a product relevant to our daily lives and we found that we all shared an interest in how we spend our free time. As a result we narrowed our idea to an app that could assist in decision making on how to get the most out of going out within a given location and getting all of one's needs met when going out; access to events, dining and drinking.
